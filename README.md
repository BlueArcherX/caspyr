Welcome to caspyr, a python project for VMware Cloud Automation Services. 

This has been born out of a need to provide some automation for the VMware Hands-On Labs, and will be built out over time to support further use cases. 

While the owner of this repository is an employee of VMware, this is not an official VMware project.
